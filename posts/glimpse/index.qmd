Instead of `str(df)` to see the structure of a dataframe, try `dplyr::glimpse()`^[Technically, `glimpse` is from the `pillar` package, but it's re-exported by `dplyr`, which I usually have loaded anyway.] instead.  It gives a horizontal output and shows more data than fits with `str()`:

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(palmerpenguins::penguins)
```

You can also force more data to be shown with the `width` option:

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(palmerpenguins::penguins, width = 200)
```
