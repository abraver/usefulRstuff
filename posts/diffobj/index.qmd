What's the difference between two `df`s?

`diffobj::diffPrint()` gives a handy visual way to check differences:

```{r}
library(diffobj)

a <- b <- matrix(1:100, ncol=2)
a <- a[-20,]
b <- b[-45,]
b[c(18, 44)] <- 999

diffPrint(target=a, current=b)
```

(In RStudio, this is shown in a colorful manner in the Viewer)

This also works for other types of objects, such as character vectors:

```{r}
diffPrint(letters[1:3], c("a", "B", "c"))
```

For more details, see the [Introduction to diffobjj vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffobj/vignettes/diffobj.html), or the [diffobj github rep](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj).
